# Friedrich Inequality

It places a bound on the $L^p$ norm of a function using $L^p$ bounds on the weak derivatives of the function and the geometry of the domain, and can be used to show that certain norms on Sobolev spaces are equivalent.

Let $\Omega$  be a bounded subset of Euclidean space $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$ with diameter $d$. Suppose that $u:\Omega \to \mathbb {R}$ lies in the Sobolev space $W_{0}^{k,p}(\Omega )$ , i.e., $u\in W^{k,p}(\Omega )$ and the trace of $u$ on the boundary $\partial\Omega$ is zero. Then

$$
\|u\|_{L^{p}(\Omega )}\leq d^{k}\left(\sum_{|\alpha |=k}\|\mathrm {D} ^{\alpha }u\|_{L^{p}(\Omega )}^{p}\right)^{1/p}
$$
