## Classical Calculus of Variations

## Abstract Variational Formulation

Let $u \in U$ be the trial function ($U$ is the trial space) and $v \in V$ be the test function ($V$ is the test space). Both $U$ and $V$ are subspaces of Hilbert spaces.

$$
u \in U
$$

$$
b(u,v) = l(v), \quad \forall v \in V
$$

- In above equation $b$ is the bilinear (or sesquilinear) form.
- $l$ is the linear (antilinear) form. 

Both bilinear and linear forms are continuous, which means they are bounded from above as shown below.

$$
\vert b(u,v) \vert \le M \Vert u \Vert_{U} \Vert v \Vert_{V}
$$

and 

$$
\vert l(v) \vert \le C \Vert v \Vert_{V}
$$

Here $M$ and $C$ are positive constants.
