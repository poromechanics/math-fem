# ð‘—• Poincare Inequality

In mathematics, the Poincare inequality allows us to obtain bounds on a function using bounds on its derivatives and the geometry of its domain of definition. It is very closely related result is Friedrichs inequality.

In general Poincare inequality states that $L_p$ norm of $v$ is bounded from above by the $L_p$ norm of gradient field $\nabla{v}$.

$$
\left(\int_{\Omega}\vert v\vert^{p}d\Omega\right)^{1/p}\le C\left(\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla v\vert^{p}\right)^{1/p},\forall v\in H_{0}^{s}\left(\Omega\right)
$$

Here, $v$ belongs to the Sobolev space of zero-trace function $W^{1,p}_{0}$.

 Assume that $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is contained in a square with side length $L$. Given that $\int_{\Gamma_{g}}{dS}\ne 0$, it follows that

$$
\left\Vert v\right\Vert_{0,\Omega} \le C\left\Vert \nabla v\right\Vert_{0,\Omega} \text{ for all }v\in\mathcal{H}_{0}^{1}
$$

where, C is the Poincare constant, and $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{0,\Omega}$ denotes the $L_2(\Omega)$ norm.
