# Dense set

In topology and related areas of mathematics, a subset A of a topological space  X is said to be **dense** in X if every point of X either belongs to A or else is arbitrarily "close" to a member of A.

For example, the rational numbers are a dense subset of the real numbers, because every real number either is a rational number or has a rational number arbitrarily close to it.

Formally, A is dense in X if the smallest closed subset of X which contains A is X itself.

## Definition

A subset A of a topological space X is said to be a **dense subset of X if any of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:

1. The smallest closed subset X containing A is X itself.
2. The closure A in X is equal to X.
3. The interior of complement of A is empty.
4. Every point in X either belongs to A or is a limit point of A.
5. For every $x\in X$, every neighborhood U of x intersects A.
6. A intersects every non-empty open subset of X.
