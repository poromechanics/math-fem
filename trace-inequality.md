# Trace inequality

Given a bounded domain $\Omega$ with a sufficiently smooth boundary $\Gamma$, a constant $C_{\Gamma}$ exists such that

$$
\left\Vert v\right\Vert _{\Gamma}\le C_{\Gamma}\left\Vert v\right\Vert _{H^{1}},\forall v\in\mathcal{H}^{1}
$$

> This means that $v$ at the boundary is bounded from above by the $H^1$ norm of v.

> Note that there is no constant $C$ such that $\Vert v \Vert_{\Gamma} \le C \Vert v \Vert$ for every $v \in L_{2}$, hence it does not make any sense to associate boundary values to the functions in $L_{2}$ space.

Let $v \in \mathcal{H}^1$, and it satisfies the [[Friedrich-Inequality]].

$$
\left\Vert \nabla v\right\Vert \le\left\Vert v\right\Vert _{H^{1}}\le C_{\Omega}\left\Vert \nabla v\right\Vert ,\forall v\in\mathcal{H}_{0}^{1}
$$
